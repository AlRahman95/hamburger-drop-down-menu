# Responsive Collapsable Navigation Bar

This repo shows a responsive collapsing navigation bar. It is a hamburger style nav bar so when it is open, it shows a hamburger like icon, but when it is clicked, it turns into an 'x', and the list in the nav bar is shown. This whole collapsable nav bar only shows when the browser is a less than a certain width (700px).
